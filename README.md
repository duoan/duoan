# 👋 Hi, I'm Duo An (Victor)

**Senior Machine Learning Engineer @ Amazon AGI**  
Scaling multimodal foundation models — optimizing how they learn, generalize, and align through data and systems co-design.

---

### 🧭 About

I work at the intersection of **machine learning and distributed systems**,  
designing large-scale **learning pipelines** and **multimodal data systems** that improve how foundation models learn from vast, diverse signals.

My focus areas:
- 🧠 **Training dynamics & optimization** — improving convergence, stability, and efficiency of large-scale multimodal models  
- 🧩 **Learning-centric systems** — integrating data, architecture, and feedback to enhance representation learning and model alignment  
- ⚙️ **Scalable orchestration** — leveraging Ray, Spark, and Kubernetes to parallelize multimodal workloads across thousands of GPUs  
- 🔍 **Evaluation & feedback loops** — automating model-driven data refinement and continual quality signals for alignment and adaptation  

> My work centers on **how models learn**, not just how they’re trained.

### ⚖️ Principles

> **1. Models and systems co-evolve.**  
> The best architectures emerge when data, compute, and learning dynamics are designed together.

> **2. Scale reveals behavior.**  
> Many learning problems only appear — and can only be solved — at massive scale.

> **3. Data is part of the model.**  
> Every batch defines what the model becomes.
